# Python in Tiny Places - An Introduction to IoT with MicroPython



Developing for microcontrollers was previously the domain of electrical engineers who used assembler and/or C/C++ with complicated toolchains and lengthy build processes. This changed radically with the introduction of Adruino, which radically simplified the coding and build process, and the provided a platform that made DIY electronics and prototyping accessible to a much wider audience. But you still had to learn to program in C/C++, which, while not terribly difficult, still presented a barrier for entry.

Python is one of the most popular languages, for good reason. It is clean and powerful, allowing developers to be very productive. Programmers get immediate feedback to their changes without having to wait for the code to compile and deploy. Need to quickly check if something would work as expected? Jump into the REPL, execute a few commands, and see their results immediately. What if you can have the power and simplicity of the Arduino platform, but with the rapid feedback loop and productivity of Python?

This is what MicroPython provides. In this course, we're going to learn about MicroPython, how to install it on Internet of Things (IoT) devices, see various development environment options, and build a working IoT application that transmits sensor readings over WiFi.

Let's get started!
